## Project Abstract

Abstract – Microhard

This CSC3170 project, based on a design from UCB CS61B, Fall 2014, requires our famous group Microhard to include a very simple query language to write a miniature relational database management system (DBMS).

The prototype Java codes provided by UCB have initiated a skeleton for DBMS and the first step for Microhard is to fill in the missing Java codes in five prototype Java files. As of December 05, Microhard has finished this job and successfully implemented the miniature DBMS. This DBMS reads query language tokens from terminal input and then invokes appropriate Java functions to perform specific operations.

Microhard then decides to add to the query language more syntaxes like "group by" (for more details please refer to Todo.md) and optimize the speed and efficiency of the DBMS. These updates will be released soon.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance.
